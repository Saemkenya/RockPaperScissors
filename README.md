# RockPaperScissors

Implementation of Rock Paper Scissors with react while they were learning it.
The code needs major refactoring and can be used as bad example.

### Implementation Path

-   [ ] -   React better to results {
        popups for rewards,
        warning and error btns on relevant events,
        show better notification and dialog boxes
        }
-   [ ] -   Use blend4web to implement the ui
-   [ ] -   Implement multi-player mode with a graphql go API server
-   [ ] -   Include unit tests - this time for real, no burn out
