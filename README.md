# RockPaperScissors

Implementation of Rock Paper Scissors with react while they were learning it. Comp is an implementation using the math.Rand package where comp is the other party in single player mode with exactly 5 gold coins that he never place as bet hence never wins nor loose.
The code needs major refactoring and can be used as bad example of working code.

### Implementation Path

-   [ ] -   Do major refactoring to [index.js]
-   [ ] -   React better to results {
        popups for rewards,
        warning and error btns on relevant events,
        show better notification and dialog boxes
        }
-   [ ] -   Use blend4web to implement the ui
-   [ ] -   Implement multi-player mode with a graphql go API server
-   [ ] -   Include unit tests - this time for real, no burn out
-   [ ] -   Play against jade stone in multiplayer mode
